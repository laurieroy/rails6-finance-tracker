# Finance Tracker App
### Created Dec 2020 as part of a Ruby on Rails tutorial by Mashrur Hossain

REQUIREMENTS:
* Authentication system, users can sign-up, edit their profile, login/out
* Users can track stocks (up to 10/user). Their profile page will display all of the stocks they are tracking along with stocks' current price
* Users can search for stocks, add and remove stocks from their portfolio
* Users can look (by name or by email) for friends, or other users of the app
* Users can view the portfolio of stocks their friends are tracking (for investing ideas)
* The app must be mobile-friendly, so styling has to be responsive

CONSTRAINTS:
* Requires fast development (story is boss is presenting at a meeting in a few days)
* Styling, while not of utmost importance, needs to be nice and presentable
* No test framework is required since it's a prototype
* Core functionality, time and presentation are key factors

Learning goals:
* Rapid prototyping using 'rails magic'
* Make use of out-of-the-box tools like bootstrap template generators
* Learn to install, configure and customize 3d party gems/tools

Third Party Gems/Tools used:
* Devise for authentication
